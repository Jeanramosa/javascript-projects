# JavaScript Exercises and Projects

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository will serve as a collection of JavaScript exercises and small projects. It's a space to practice, learn, and share progress as I continue to grow in web development.  

Below is a list of current repositories included in this collection. I will keep this updated as new projects are added.
